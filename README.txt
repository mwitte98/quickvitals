Some things to note:
* Our prototype does not use database as of yet, so entering data will not make
  it persist
* The above bullet applies to the following actions:
  * Recording a new measurement for vital signs (it will show up on the graph
    and table but will not persist)
  * Registering a new Patient into the system
  * Editing the Profile of an existing patient
  * Adding a new task to be completed for the patient
  * Marking an existing task as completed.
